## Curvature:
  # Curvature2D: 
    This code computes the curvature of a tropical triangle with bidimensional coordinates in the tropical projective torus R^3/R1.
    
  # CurvatureND:
    This code computes the curvature of a tropical triangle with N-dimensional coordinates.
    
  # sampleUltrametric_Rudy:
    This code uses Rudy's code (see References) to generate Ultrametric trees then I sample from the generated batch and compute the curvature.
